# Whispers In The Dark  

Here is my first try to do a 3D game!

My game looks like this rn... The little white thing is our player and the red thing is fatal for our player... Yea i know its gud (｡╯︵╰｡)

And today i created start and end screens maybe 1 more screen for player death... But they looks pretty gud in my opinion.
